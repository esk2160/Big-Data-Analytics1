Assignment 1

The task at hand is to write a file/repository and push it to Github.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
Github account, installing github

Installing

Step 1: Create a local git repository in the folder you would like with the code: cd (where you want the file)

Step 2: Run the code: git init

Step 3: Register by running the code: 
git config user.email "  "
git config user.name "  "

Step 4: Run the code: git add FILENAME and then run git status

Step 5: Commit the new file by running the code: git commit -m FOLDERNAME

Step 6: Create a new branch by running: git checkout -b <branch name>

Step 7: Create a new repository on the github website. Once created, copy/paste the code generated to Terminal.
